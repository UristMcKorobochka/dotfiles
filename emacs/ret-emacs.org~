* Overview
** Canonical links to this document
** What is this
The present document, referred to in the source code part as =prot-emacs.org=, contains the bulk of my configurations for GNU Emacs.
It is designed using principles of "literate programming": a combination of ordinary language and inline code blocks.
Emacs knows how to parse this file properly so as to evaluate only the Elisp ("Emacs Lisp") included herein.
The rest is for humans to make sense of my additions and their underlying rationale.

Literate programming allows us to be more expressive and deliberate.
Not only can we use typography to its maximum potential (elaborate more), but may also employ techniques such as internal links between sections.
This makes the final product much more useful for end users than, say a terse script.

Each section provides information about the code it contains. In case you feel something is missing, I maintain a (*link* Frequently Asked Questions) section (when in doubt, or to offer feedback, suggestions, further comments, etc., do (*link* contact me).

In more practical terms, this document is written using =org-mode=. It contains all /package configurations/ for my Emacs setup.
To actually work, it needs to be initialised from another file that only covers the absolute essentials.

*** Contents of my init.el
The =prot-emacs.org= is loaded from an other file, named =init.el= per the Emacs conventions.
Mine is designed to just load the file with my configurations (i.e. the present document).
The package management is done by Guix outside Emacs.
Emacs loads the package autoloads from `load-path'

#+include: init.el src emacs-lisp :tangle no

**** The =early-init.el=
#+include: early-init.el src emacs-lisp :tangle no

*** About the source code version of this document
In the =org-mode= version of this document, I make sure that the
above-referenced code blocks have =:tangle no= Org property so they are not accidentally parsed by the actual setup and serve as mere examples.
** Writing style
*** Avoid these phrases (with reasons)
**** This section contains configurations that are needed
Yes -- this is a section and it contains whatever it contains, configurations if not stated otherwise, that are needed if not stated otherwise.
** COPYING
* Base
Relatevly few things needed prior to the setup of everything else.
** Update .el version on killing
So that all changes are applied on next start
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package emacs
		  :config
		  (defun ret/delete-emacs-init ()
		    (interactive ((config "~/.config/emacs/emacs-init.el"))
				 (when config
				   (delete-file config))))
		  :hook ((kill-emacs-hook . ret/delete-emacs-init)))
		    
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   | ret/delete-emacs-init |

** Theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t)
    )
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : t
